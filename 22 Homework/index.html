        <h3>3D retro art to melt your face</h3>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>All of these awesome graphics were created by the amazing Matthew DiVito (aka mr. div). He is a 28 year old motion graphics designer and an aspiring game developer. Located in Boston, MA. Using tools like After Effects and Cinema 4D for all of his gifs. To actually save out the gif files he use Photoshop. You may know his work from a recent game called <a href="no-mans-sky.com">no-mans-sky.com.</a>

            <li><img src="./img/set1/crystal.gif"></li>
            <li><img src="./img/set1/polytronic.gif"></li>
            <li><img src="./img/set1/retro_break.gif"></li>
            <li><img src="./img/set1/waves_final.gif"></li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>He has created many GIFs that you may have seen but never knew who actually did the work. Like the game no-mans-sky or music album covers and msuic videos for <a href="http://www.krismenace.com/krismenace/release/theentiretyofmatter#main">Kris Menace.</a> With most of his working having a retro feel and me being an 80's nut, I stumbled on his work and had to find more. He has built a very nice portfolio of GIFs/Videos and you can see them all here at his website <a href="http://matthewdivito.com">matthewdivito.com.</a>

    	<h1>totally awesome</h1>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>He has a very retro style to his work that doesn't just resemble the 80's but also has a timeless style. Animating these spectacular creations just adds another world to each peice. I'm like this guys work so much I'd totally want to cover an entire wall of his GIFs all printed with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenticular_printing">lenticular printing</a> style. If you haven't even seen images printed in a way that when you flex or angle slightly the image it looks like it is moving. Teaming up with <a href="http://gifpop.io/">GIFPop.io</a> for a kickstarter <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sha/gifpop-custom-gif-cards-for-everyone">campaign</a> mr. div create this GIF titled <a href="http://gifpop.io/products/mr-div-orange-slice">'orange sicle',</a> and <a href="http://gifpop.io/collections/artists/products/mr-div-retro-sphere">'retro sphere'</a> printed in just that way.</p>
